# CORTXFS

The CORTX File System (FS) framework on top of the cloud object storage is the entry point for file access protocols (like NFS, CIFS). The CORTXFS makes use of the NSAL and DSAL libraries to provide the file system framework. The [NSAL library](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-nsal) provides namespace for the file system framework and the [DSAL library](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-dsal) provide data storage functionality for the file system framework.
